      <h2>How to View Instagram Stories Anonymously</h2>
      <p>Instagram stories disappear after 24 hours, and normally you'd need to log in to view them — which means the poster sees your name in their viewer list. Our <strong>Instagram Story Viewer</strong> solves this problem completely.</p>
      
      <p>With InstaViewer, you can watch anyone's Instagram stories without them ever knowing. Your identity stays completely hidden. No account creation, no app downloads, no personal data required.</p>

      <h2>Why Use Our Instagram Story Viewer?</h2>

          <h3>Completely Anonymous</h3>
          <p>The story owner will never see your name in their viewers list. Browse stories without leaving any trace of your visit. Perfect for viewing stories from exes, competitors, or anyone whose attention you'd prefer to avoid.</p>
