      <h2>What Is an Anonymous Instagram Viewer?</h2>
      <p>An anonymous Instagram viewer is a web-based tool that lets you browse public Instagram content — profiles, posts, stories, and reels — without logging into Instagram or revealing your identity. When you use InstaViewer, the account owner has no way of knowing you visited their profile or watched their stories.</p>

      <p>Unlike browsing Instagram directly (where your profile appears in story viewer lists and your activity is tracked), anonymous viewers act as an intermediary. Our servers fetch the content and display it to you, keeping your identity completely separate from the request.</p>

      <h2>Why People Use Anonymous Instagram Viewers</h2>
      <p>There are many legitimate reasons to browse Instagram anonymously:</p>
      <ul style="color: var(--text-secondary); line-height: 2; margin: 20px 0; padding-left: 20px;">
        <li><strong>Research:</strong> Journalists, marketers, and researchers need to study public profiles without influencing the subject's behavior.</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> You may want to check someone's public profile without them knowing — whether it's a potential date, an old friend, or a business contact.</li>
        <li><strong>No Account:</strong> Not everyone wants an Instagram account. Our viewer lets you access public content without signing up.</li>
        <li><strong>Competitor Analysis:</strong> Businesses monitor competitors' Instagram activity without tipping them off.</li>
        <li><strong>Content Saving:</strong> Download photos, videos, and stories before they disappear.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Is Anonymous Instagram Viewing Legal?</h2>
      <p>Yes. Viewing publicly available content on the internet is legal in most jurisdictions. InstaViewer only accesses content that Instagram users have chosen to make public. We cannot and do not access private accounts, direct messages, or any content behind privacy settings.</p>

      <p>Think of it this way: if someone's Instagram profile is public, anyone in the world can view it — with or without an Instagram account. InstaViewer simply provides a more convenient and private way to do so.</p>
